My solutions written in C#. 

### Running the code

Each day's solution is a static class and can be executed using the format `DayXX.Solve()` from `Program.cs` where `XX` is a zero padded day of December. 
Input data files have been omitted from the repo but you can add your own by creating a `project root/inputs` folder and updating the filename accordingly in the `DayXX.cs` files.
